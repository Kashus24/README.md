### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```Javascript
fconst whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
 
if (hungry === true && availableTime < 20) {
    return "Pick up a snack or grab something you have ready at home.";
    } 
    else if (hungry === true && (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30)) {
      return "You deserve a break and should take time to cook a tasty meal.";
    } 
    else if (hungry === true && availableTime > 30) {
      return "This is an intense program after all and you should probably reconsider.";
    } else {
      return "Wait untill you are hungry!";
  }
};
```
